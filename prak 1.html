        <h2 style="text-align: center">Dribbling the Basketball </h2>

        <p>There are two ways to move the basketball. The preferred and quicker method is the pass. However, if the defense is tight
            and the passing lanes clogged, the dribble is used to set up the offense. Since the dribble can only begin and stop one time
            it is in a player's possession, he should make his dribble count. It has to have a purpose! 
        </p>

        <p>The dribble, along with the pass and the shot is one of the offensive triple threats every player must have in his arsenal.
            Use the dribble to: 
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Move the ball on offense. </li>
            <li>Blow past your man to the hoop. Blow past your man to the hoop. </li>
            <li>Escape from a tough and sticky defense. </li>
            <li>Shoot.</li>
            <li>Move around a screen and get off your shot behind it. </li>
            <li>Get a better passing angle.</li>
            <li>Freeze the ball in the closing minutes. </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Don't pound the air out of the ball going nowhere. If you want to get from point "A" to point "B", do it with the least
            amount of dribbling that's possible. Once you put the ball on the floor, it should be to help you get where you want to go.
            If the dribble can't help you, pass to a teammate.
        </p>

        <p>Isiah Thomas said, "The mistake that I see many young players make on the court is that they just dribble too much. Many
            of these players don't realize they're hogging the ball because they're too intent on their own dribbling. But while they are
            playing with the ball, four other teammates are standing around waiting for something to happen. Before you know it, the
            defense begins to tighten. More often, than not, the dribbler gets trapped and turns the ball over to the defense, which
            often scores two easy points."
        </p>

        <h2>How to Dribble</h2>

        <P>Contrary to what many young players actually do, dribbling is not done while staring at the ball. You dribble with your
            fingertips and pads of the hands without looking at the ball. Keep your head up at all times. Keep your eyes focused on
            what's happening on the court.
        </P>

        <P>A properly inflated basketball will always bounce straight up at least 75-percent of the height from which it was dropped.
            Therefore, you don't have to watch the ball as you dribble. "See" with your fingertips. Simply have your fingers there to
            feel and control the ball.
        </P>

        <p>To dribble, push the ball down by spreading the fingers and flexing the wrist. You don't need to push it down hard. Light
            pressure is enough. Also, keep your legs flexed and your back straight, ready to make a quick move.
        </p>

        <p>All players should learn to dribble equally well with both hands. This ambidextrous ability will open up your offensive
            game. It will help discourage the defense from trying to overplay you on your strong side.
        </p>

        <p> There is one important rule to keep in mind whenever you decide to put the ball on the floor. Do not pick up your dribble,
            until you know what you are going to do with the ball! 
        </p>
